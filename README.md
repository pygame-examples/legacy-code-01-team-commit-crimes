# Unofficial Pygame Community Pass-the-code Game Jam 2025
There are two teams, each creating a game. Only one person from each team works at the team's project in a given moment. Each participant has as week to work on the project. After that time is up, it's the turn for the next person. Commit to the repository regularly to avoid code loss (in your time frame).

Team one Commit Crimes:

# Rules
Rules in use are a modified version of those for https://itch.io/jam/pygame-community-fall-jam-2024

- Pre-existing engine/utility code can be reused for this jam. However, code specific for this jam must be created after the jam starts.
- Pygame(-ce) must be the primary tool used for rendering and sound. Using things such as, e.g. modernGL for shaders or pyaudio for sound manipulation is allowed, but pygame must be used for the bulk of the work. This helps to keep things even between participants. (If possible, the pygame-ce fork of pygame should be used).
- You MUST create all assets used in your entry during the jam. Asset generators are perfectly fine to use, but NO premade assets are allowed, even if you have the rights to them. This includes creative commons works (even CC0). Exceptions:
- Things in the public domain that are over ~70 years old (e.g. classical music pieces, old paintings, etc)
- Fonts (which you must, of course, still have license to use).
- Premade splash screens or logos
- Pygame assets from https://pyga.me/docs/logos.html exclusively.
- Please be careful with delicate or controversial subject matter. Do not make games with NSFW/18+ content. If you are unsure whether you can include something in your entry, ask a member of staff on the Discord server.
- Follow the spirit of pass-the-code challenge: the communication regarding the development of the submission should only happen through the code that is implemented. Each participant has the freedom of interpreting by themselves what's the game that is created.
- The winning submission will be determined by a popularity vote determined by a number of stars that a given submission got in the submission channel (reactions by participants don't count).
- The last member of a team is also tasked with creating a submission on #showcase-submissions within their time-frame (this includes "marketing materials", like showcase videos).
- You are not allowed to have fun throughout the creation process. Any team caught enjoying the jam will be disqualified! /s
